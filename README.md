### `TASK:`

In this assignment, you're supposed to develop a frontend basic application using the create-react-app package. The application should have the following key features:

1) A very basic minimal responsive navbar.

2) Fetch restaurant data from the Yelp API and display it below the navbar. No fancy formatting/UI is required here. You can just display the raw data received in JSON format below the navbar.

3) Create a proper git repo for the project. Make separate commits for each feature that you're adding. Don't push all your code in one commit. If you do that your submission will be rejected. If you have any questions feel free to ask them.
